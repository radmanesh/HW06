## Our Git Usage Guidelines:
+ Please pay attention to the files you are adding to the repository, try not to add irrelevant files. You can add the files that you don't want to be in the repo in `.gitignore` file in the root dir.
+ Always work on your own branch and **never** push to **main** branch. Use pull request.
+ If your branch gets behind the main branch, try to merge **main** into your branch as soon as you can. This will make your work and the team's much easier in the long process.
+ If you don't know what to do, just do it on your branch and let me know.
+ Try to provide a minimal commit message
